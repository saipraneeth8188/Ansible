# Ansible Introduction

## What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It is **agentless**, which means it doesn't require any software to be installed on the managed nodes. It communicates over **SSH** for Linux and **WinRM** for Windows.

---

## Why Ansible?

- ‚úÖ Simple to learn (uses YAML syntax)
- ‚úÖ No agent installation required
- ‚úÖ Works over SSH (secure communication)
- ‚úÖ Scalable for large infrastructures
- ‚úÖ Idempotent: Re-running the same playbook doesn't change the system if it's already in the desired state.

---

## Key Features

- Declarative language (YAML)
- Inventory management (static or dynamic)
- Role-based playbook structure for reusability
- Built-in modules for common tasks (e.g., copy, file, package, service)
- Extensible with custom modules and plugins

---

## Real-World Use Cases

- Install and configure Docker on Linux VMs
- Deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters
- Automate patching and package updates
- Push application code and restart services

## Architecture Overview

| Component      | Description                                                  |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Control Node   | The machine where Ansible is installed                       |
| Managed Node   | Target machines (Linux/Windows) accessed via SSH/WinRM       |
| Inventory      | List of managed nodes (IPs, hostnames, etc.)                 |
| Playbooks      | YAML files containing tasks and roles                        |
| Modules        | Reusable units of code (e.g., `yum`, `apt`, `service`)       |

## Common Terminology

| Term      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Playbook** | YAML file with one or more plays (set of tasks) |
| **Task**     | A single action (e.g., install package, start service) |
| **Module**   | Unit of work executed by a task |
| **Inventory**| Hosts or groups of hosts to manage |
| **Role**     | Directory structure for organizing playbooks |
| **Handler**  | Special task triggered by `notify` (e.g., restart nginx) |
| **Facts**    | System information automatically gathered |

## üîÑ Ansible vs Chef

| Feature               | Ansible                            | Chef                            |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Language              | YAML                                | Ruby DSL                         |
| Agentless             | ‚úÖ Yes                              | ‚ùå Requires agent (Chef-client)   |
| Learning Curve        | Easy (declarative YAML)             | Steeper (requires Ruby DSL)      |
| Communication         | SSH/WinRM                           | Chef Server-Agent model          |
| Idempotent            | ‚úÖ Yes                              | ‚úÖ Yes                            |
| Ease of Setup         | Simple                              | More complex                     |
| Community Support     | Strong                              | Strong                           |

## Summary

Ansible makes infrastructure automation **simple**, **repeatable**, and **secure** using SSH and declarative YAML syntax. It is widely used for configuration management, service orchestration, and application deployment.
